Made with [LOVE](https://love2d.org)

## Building:

1. Go to the `scripts/` folder and then run `./generate_fonts generate_fonts`, `./generate_fonts convert_fonts`, and `./generate_fonts copy_fonts` first. This is only required once.
2. Then run `./build init` to setup the directories and copy the assets to the output directory.
3. Then `./build run` to preprocess and run the game.

When modifying files in the `res/` or in the `modules/` directory, you should update with `./build rebuild` before running again.

For cleaning files and logs `./build clean && ./build clean_logs`

(see [buid.sh](build.sh) for more info)
